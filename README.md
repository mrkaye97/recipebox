# Recipebox

Recipebox is a digital version of my mom's index card boxes in our kitchen, filled with hand-written recipes.

The goal is to digitize those cards so that all of my recipes are in one place, but with a few added features:

1. Simpler ingestion: Just paste a link or take a photo of a cookbook.
2. Recipe recommendations to answer "what should I cook tonight?" which I find myself asking often.
3. Social features to see what friends and family are cooking and share recipes with them.
4. Grocery list exports from selected recipes.
