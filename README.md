# recipebox

Recipebox is a digital version of my mom's boxes filled with index cards with recipes written on them in our kitchen. The idea is for it to achieve the same goals as those cards, but with simpler ingestion, and some basic recommendations and ingestion features to make life easier for seeing what your friends are cooking, and figuring out what to make for dinner.
